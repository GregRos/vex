# Vex

This is the experimental chat UI project. I got to 'vex' like this:

```
Conversation Codex (too long) -> Convex (too mathy) -> Vex
```

However, I'm not sure if I like it. I'm open to suggestions.

## Goals
To reimagine how conversation AI is used. Some ideas:

1. Optimized for 1080p and 1440p ONLY, with conessions for 720p
2. Use memory and storage like a desktop app
2. Mostly non-responsive
2. WYSYWIG message editting.
3. conversation branching.
4. optimized history display
5. strong keyboard navigation and shortcuts
6. 
4. keywords/hashtags
6. Powerful search
8. self-hosted + a trial version we can host (maybe a route to monetization?)
9. generic for different AI backends
10. use graph database for backend storage

## Techs used
1. Node.js
2. TypeScript
3. React

## Development tools
1. npm
2. Obsidian for documentation, drawing stuff
3. VSCode or PyCharm
4. git
2. Adobe XD for UI design (optional)

## Components
1. ProseMirror, an open source rich text editor and viewer.

## Storage
Right now we'll use JSON files and stuff. However, in the future:
1. If graph DB, then probably https://memgraph.com/
2. If regular DB, probably cassandra
